# Story book!
# Create a dictionary with 3 stories inside! Like a book :)
# each story should be it's own dictionary with:
# beginning, middle, end, hero

# Iterate over the book, and print out each story! Print All of :)
# formatted of course

#hints:
    # you already built a dictionary with a story
    # You already have something to prompt user for input and build dictionaries
    # now what we want to do is create a book that holds 3 stories

# extra:
    # Create a while loop so we don't stop listening to stories unless we tell it to break!
